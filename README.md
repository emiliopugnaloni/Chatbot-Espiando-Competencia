# Chatabot: Espiando a la Competencia

Chatbot part of the final group project of the Text Minning subject in Data Mining's Master degree in UBA. 

The project was about creating a Weekly Review of the competitors of a consulting firm, and also a chatbot where employees can interact to understand the news of the competitors. For this, web scrapping of companies sites, yahoo finance and google news was necesary to obtain the last news. Based on this information, the products were created using GPT LLM.

For the chatbot part of the project, a Conversational-Rag was created with Lang-Chain, using a Pinecone vector-database. The chabot was published as a StreamLit App: https://textminingchatbot.streamlit.app/

This is the structure of the chatbot:
